# What's going on?

This website was created to support a grocery delivery business at Duke University and acted as the online ordering platform and the backend for logistics. It was developed on RoR with Ruby 4.0.0

# Gems

The backend was designed with the Active Admin gem (https://github.com/gregbell/active_admin)
The gemfile can be checked for the other gems including "devise", "paperclip" and "kaminari"

# Currently

The website is currently not operational as the business has been put on hold. The code however, is still fully operational and can be used as a template.
